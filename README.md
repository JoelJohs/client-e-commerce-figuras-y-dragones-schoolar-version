# E-commerce client side - Schoolar Project

## Introduction

This project is an individual practice exercise to apply all my previous lessons while also serving as a school project. Although the repository currently lacks relevant content, I wanted to get a head start.

## Branch Information

Please note that the `route-config` branch was created solely for practice purposes, including branch management and pull request workflows. It does not contain any production code and should not be used for development or deployment.
